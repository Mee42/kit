diff files are arranged in a nested contextual format.
There are different `scopes` that the text passes though.
diff files start in `project scope`

to enter file scope, use the keyword `enter file (FILE)`
to exit file scope, use the keyword `pop`.
anything after the keyword is ignored,
so the type of scope being exited should be specified, ie `pop file`.

the idea with git is that there is a pipeline, `a -> b` which is described by a diff, so that with just the diff and `a`
a program can construct `b`

you can start a edit-chunk by typing `LINE (LINE-NUMBER)`.
This is followed by zero or more lines starting with `-`,
and then zero or more lines starting with `+`

The line number should be the number of the first erased line (zero indexed).
The idea is that the `+` replaces the `-`.

you exit the line mode by having a line that does not start with a + or a -.
You can then add more LINE fields or pop the file scope.
